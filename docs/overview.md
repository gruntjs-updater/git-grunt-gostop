*This plugin was designed to work with Grunt 0.4.x. If you're still using grunt v0.3.x it's strongly recommended that [you upgrade](http://gruntjs.com/upgrading-from-0.3-to-0.4), but in case you can't please use [v0.3.2](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin/tree/grunt-0.3-stable).*

For a working example of git-grunt-gorun and git-grunt-gostop, check out [this branch of git-go-websiteskeleton](https://github.com/jadekler/git-go-websiteskeleton/tree/grunt). Also check out [gorun](https://github.com/jadekler/git-grunt-gorun) and [gobuild](https://github.com/jadekler/git-grunt-gobuild) for other go/grunt modules.
